<h1>DATA STRUCTURE</h1>
<p id="para1">
A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. 
<br>It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are
<br> used in almost every program or software system that has been developed.
<br> So we must have good knowledge about data structures. 
</p>
<h2>1.Array</h2>

<p class="second">
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.<br>
 The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. <br>
This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value,<br>
 i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).<br>
</p>
<h2>2.Linked List</h2>
<p class="center">
A linked list is a linear data structure,<br>
in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. <br>
The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:<br>
</p>
<h2>3.Stack</h2>
<p id="para2">
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.<br>
The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).<br>
There are many real-life examples of a stack. <br>
Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen.<br>
The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, <br>
i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time.<br>
So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.<br>
